# The 2025 Indigo Crisis : Operational Disruptions' Analysis  

## Overview   
Between 2nd December and 12th December, 2025, IndiGo Airlines faced a crew and pilot shortage leading to nationwide flight disruptions. It was unable to create a functioning roster that adhered to the new Directorate of Civil Aviations'(DGCA) Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations. These regulations altered the established structure of crew management, but IndiGo was unable to align itself with them in time. This led to an airline operational crisis affecting all the major airports of India. Approximately 5,000+ flights cancelled during this period, while thousands more were delayed. Its market share dropped from 64.2% by 16.4% by 5th December. 

## Systems Inovolved  
* Crew scheduling
* Aircraft Rotations
* Passenger communications

### Timeline of events 
* June 2024, Proposal and introduction of reviewed FDTL, introducing changes like:
  * Pilots have 48 instead of 36 consecutive hours of rest
  * 'Night' timings are midnight to 6am, instead of till 5 am.
  * Night landings reduced form 6 to 2
* Airlines push for more time, hence its adoption was divided into two parts,
  * Phase 1, implemented by 1st July, 2025
  * Phase 2, implemented by 1st November, 2025
* IndiGo succesfully completed phase 1, but was unable to complete phase 2 in time.
* As a result, started suffering delays. On time report dropped to 63.4% (November) from 87.2%(October)
* On December 5th,
   * massive air traffic congestion
   * technical issues ( a wider Microsoft outage exacerbated the situation)
   * cyclone Ditwah disrupted movements in Chennai and other coastal hubs.
   * fog problems in Delhi, Lucknow airports
   * inefficient crew and pilot rosters
   * pilot shortage
 together caused operational disruptions along various hubs across India. Within a week, there were nearly 2,000 flights cancelled.
* Seeing the situation, DGCA allowed a temporary exemption to IndiGo until Februrary 10th, 2026. However, IndiGo would have to submit reports to DGCA uevery fortnight until then.


### Impacts Of the Crisis 
* IndiGo Airlines lost millions in revenues because of cncellations, reschedules and delays
* IndiGo's parent company InterGlobe lost 37,000 Cr+ in six trading sessions, its shares went down by 16.4%.
* On the 8th of december itself, IndiGo refunded Rs. 827 Cr to passengers with flights uptill the 12th of december, 2025.
* IndiGo's On time Performance went down from 91.4% in July, 2025 to 3.7% on December 5th, 2025.
* Suffered massive market cap erosion at Rs. 16,000+ Cr.
* Delhi lost nearly Rs. 1000+ Cr in revenue loss in tourism/travel.
* Pieter Elbers (CEO of IndiGo Airlines) repeatedly and "profusely" apologized on social media platforms, assuring the operations would resume soon.
* DGCA imposed a schedule and flight number reduction by 10% seeing the extent of the operational meltdown.
* DGCA will be imposing regulatory scrutiny on IndiGo and its operations, demanding reports on operations every 15 days.
* Exposed the fragility of the Indian aviation market and its overdependence on a single aviation line. It also highlighted the dangers of the "Too big to fail" ideology and provoked discussions on need for improvements in the aviation sector and its regulation system.
* IndiGo suffered damage to the name and brand it had built over 20+ years, as it was trusted and growing due to its low fares and on time journey reputations.
* As the blow to its reputation of punctuality hit, other airlines capitalized on the stranded passengers.
* Wide scale operational chaos as over 5,000 flights were cancelled in the span of two weeks.
  
### Lessons and Improvements
* The biggets lesson is that a near duopoly like situation exists in the aviation market as of now, which must be fixed in order to improve the situation and dependency of the market. It is clearly harmful to the country's economic system's stability. 
* To do so, the government needs to reduce the price of fuels so as to give smaller airlines a chance to grow.
* DGCA needs to be more regular with its regulations and insepctions of the airlines.
* The Competition Council of India (C.C.I.) should be more active and assertive in its role, ensuring that smaller companies see a chance to grow and experience fair competition.
* The government needs to assert growth of the industry as a whole, so that bigger giants don't domninate but support the system, and smaller companies also grow. That way, the sector will not experience complete dependency on any one company and monopoly and duopoly like environments (which are destructive to a growing economy like India's) could be avoided.
* As of December 18th, 2025, IndiGo has succesfully recovered flight operations, (with approx 2,200 flights flying daily) and its On time Performance has once again grown to 90-91%.
