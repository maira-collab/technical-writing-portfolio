# The 2025 Indigo Crisis : Operational Disruptions' Analysis  

## Overview   
Between 5th December and 12th December, 2025, IndiGo faced a crew and pilot shortage. It was unable to create a functioning roster that adhered to the new Directorate of Civil Aviations'(DGCA) Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations. Hence, there were 5,000+ flights cancelled during this period, thousands more delayed. Its market share dropped from 65% by 17% by 5th December. 

## Systems Inovolved

  * 'Night' timings are midnight to 6am, instead of till 5 am.
  * Night landings reduced form 6 to 2
* Airlines push for more time, hence adaption divided into two parts,
  * Phase 1, implemented by 1st July, 2025
  * Phase 2, implemented by 1st November, 2025
